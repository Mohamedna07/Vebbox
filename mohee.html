<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Center for Disaster Philanthropy’s <b>(CDP)</b> response to this crisis is focused on humanitarian needs that arise, particularly among internally displaced peoples (IDPs) and refugees. We are not looking at the conflict itself except for how it affects population movement and humanitarian needs. To that end, this profile is not providing detailed updates about the status of the war as we believe that is better done by news media.

The school year in Ukraine began on <b>Sept. 1</b>, but the situation for children is far from normal. Officials say <b>six months of war have damaged 2,400 schools across the country</b>, including <b>269 that were completely destroyed</b>.

According to Save the Children, “an average of four <b>preschools</b> a day have been damaged or destroyed in <b>the war in Ukraine, putting children’s</b> early development in jeopardy as the new school year begins.” <b>Getting children back to learning, in classrooms</b> when it is deemed safe, and through online or community-based alternatives is critical.

Humanitarian challenges continue to grow and aid workers are anticipating a multi-year recovery will be required.
